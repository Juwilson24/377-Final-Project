### Bigger Picture Question
How does geographic location impact real estate prices, demand, and investment opportunities? More specifically, how do regional factors such as proximity to amenities, socioeconomic conditions, or climate risks influence residential property values and market trends?

This is a broad and widely studied question in real estate economics and urban planning. Our project aims to explore a slice of this broader issue with data-driven methods.

### Specific Research Question(s)
How do real estate prices vary based on proximity to amenities like public transportation, schools, and green spaces in a specific metropolitan area (e.g., New York City or Los Angeles)?

1. Are property values significantly impacted by neighborhood-level characteristics such as average income, crime rates, or walkability scores?

2. Does climate risk (e.g. flood zones) correlate with lower home values, and is this impact more noticeable in some neighborhoods?

These specific questions aim to shed light on how spatial and socioeconomic features influence housing prices within a single city or metro area.

### Type of Project
This is primarily an explanatory/relationship-based project.

## Hypotheses
H1: *Homes closer to public transit hubs or good schools command higher prices.*

H2: *Neighborhoods with higher average income and lower crime rates have higher real estate values.*

H3: *Properties located in areas with climate-related risks (e.g. flood zones) have lower values, controlling for other factors.*


## Metrics of Success
**Statistical significance of location-based predictors in a regression or model.**

1. Model performance (if we use prediction methods): RÂ² or MAE on test set.

2. Clarity of spatial patterns shown in maps or visualizations.

Baseline: *Previous studies or Zillow research reports can give ballpark estimates (e.g., how much a 1-point increase in walkability boosts home prices).*
